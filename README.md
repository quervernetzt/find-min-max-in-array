# Find Min Max In Array

- In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. 

- The code should run in O(n) time. 

- Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.

- Have only a single traversal.


# How to use it

- Run `./main.py` what will execute the test cases in `./tests` and a demo.
